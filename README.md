# Image-Retargeting-A-Dataset-and-Metrics
=====
The lack of a comprehensive dataset with annotations and evaluation metrics has hindered the development and assessment of retargeting models. In this work, we address this critical gap by constructing a novel dataset that not only encompasses a wide range of input/output ratios, object counts, and layouts but also includes annotations on object distributions post-retargeting.
