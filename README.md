# Image-Retargeting-A-Dataset-and-Metrics
We construct a novel dataset that not only encompasses a wide range of input/output ratios, object counts, and layouts but also includes annotations on object distributions post-retargeting. 
First, in terms of the number of instances, our dataset far exceeds RetargetMe in the number of instances, for example, the number of three-instance images is 15 times that of RetargetMe , indicating that this dataset can provide richer data for difficult tasks.<br>

Second, in terms of aspect ratio distribution, our dataset covers a wider range of ratios, e.g., the number of 4:3 aspect ratio images is 18 times that of RetargetMe, and it is significantly larger in multiple aspect ratios, ensuring the balance and applicability of the data.
